            <h4 class="text-purple">OUR STORY</h4>
            <P>Across Africa, many women are leading change in their communities, and contributing to solving Africa's
                numerous challenges—teaching in rural schools, running health awareness campaings, advocating for gender
                equality, and driving social innovation. But then we want to equip them, as well as all that'll help
                them do their work, to be able to do more or scale their impact digitally without facing physical
                constraints.
            </p>

            <p>Despite having a burning passion to make a difference, without having the platform and the skills to lead
                and reach people globally, it becomes difficult to mobilize people, raise funds, or expand impact.</p>

            <p>SheInternet was born out of the need to bridge this gap. We saw how women working in the social
                sector—weather through NGO's, nonprofits, or grassroots initiatives or even small scale
                innovators—struggled to scale their efforts due to digital barriers. Inspired by their resillience, we
                set out to provide them with the tools they need to thrive. In our supports, we will equip these women
                with the knowledge, skills and confidence to tell their stories, build their influence, and be global
                leaders through digitals training, mentorship, and networking.</p>
